** PROJECT OVERVIEW **  
Chromatic dispersion, which describes the wavelength-dependent propagation of light, is crucial for  various applications in imaging, communications, spectroscopy, and nonlinear optics. However, engineering dispersion in complex photonic structures like metamaterials and photonic crystals is computationally intensive and non-intuitive, requiring exhaustive numerical simulations. A key challenge is designing broadband achromatic metasurfaces, where each meta-atom’s geometry must be carefully optimized to achieve the desired group delay and dispersion. Traditional methods rely on brute-force modeling techniques, which are not only time-consuming but also limited to specific material and geometric configurations, necessitating repeated simulations for different design parameters. This inefficiency makes it difficult to explore the full potential of dispersion-engineered devices and predict their practical performance limits.  
To overcome these limitations, a new inverse design approach is proposed, leveraging physics-informed deep learning and large language models (LLMs) to automate photonic component design. This tool will enable users to specify desired broadband optical properties through natural language and graphical inputs, significantly reducing the expertise and computational resources required. Unlike traditional methods, this approach will generalize across different material and geometric parameters, making dispersion engineering more accessible to a wider range of scientists and engineers. By streamlining the design process, this tool will not only advance metasurface optics but also benefit other fields requiring broadband operation, such as RF engineering and circuit design, ultimately transforming the way complex photonic devices are developed.  
This project is a continuation of the project that I began this spring. I have already created a Generative Adversarial Network, and it is being trained this week. Once it is trained, it will be used to predict the waveguide shape and substrate atom to determine the wave modes at a specific wavelength. From there, it will be compared to simulation and/or experiment, before the task is extended to creating full arrays of waveguides for lenses for specific focal distances.  
** PERSONAL STATEMENT / GOALS **  
I’m excited about this project because it combines two areas I’m passionate about: physics and artificial intelligence. The intersection of these fields is fascinating to me, and I’m eager to contribute to a project that uses advanced deep learning techniques to tackle complex physical problems.	  
Through this experience, I hope to build my skills in working with tools like PyTorch and other deep learning frameworks, particularly in imaging applications. I’m looking forward to gaining more hands-on experience with these models and learning more about their role in solving real-world challenges in physics. This project feels like a perfect opportunity to deepen my understanding of both fields while contributing to meaningful research.  
Already I have learned an incredible amount about GAN implementation and photonics. Eventually seeing a physical lens created from this work would be an incredibly vindicating experience.
